    "  + To test the AI performance, first, we extract A, B, C as test suite 1.\n",
    "  + After running test suite 1, we generate a different test suite (2), with students D, E, F.\n",
    "    + See the problem? We are slowly letting the ML model know almost all of the 10 students (A, B, C, D, E, F). This is not good, because: \n",
    "  + ML is overfitting (learn A, B, C, D, E, F) by heart (e.g. these students tend to score between 7 and 8 points). However, in reality, they might score 5-6 points, or 8-9 points.\n",
